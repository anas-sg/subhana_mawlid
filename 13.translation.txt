O Prophet, peace be upon you
O Messenger, peace be upon you

O Beloved, peace be upon you
Allah’s blessings be upon you

The full moon has risen on us
Then all other full moons have disappeared

We have not seen anything like your beauty
Never, O the face of happiness

You are a sun, you are a full moon
You are the light over light

You are the Elixir of life and precious
You are the lamps of the chests

O my beloved one, O Muhammad
O the bridegroom of the east and the west

O The Supported One, O the Glorified
O Imam of the Two Qiblas

Whoever has seen your face is very fortunate
O The One whose parents are very noble

Your pure and cooled Hauḍul Kauṯar
Is our gathering point on the day of resurrection

You are the forgiver of all mistakes
and of all destructive sins

You are the hider of defects
And the remover of falls and slips

O master of good deeds
O the one of high status

One who removes my sins
And forgives my mistakes

The one who knows secrets and hidden matters
The one who responds to invocations

O our Lord, bless all of us
For all kinds of good deeds

O Prophet, peace be upon you
O Messenger, peace be upon you

O Beloved, peace be upon you
Allah’s blessings be upon you
