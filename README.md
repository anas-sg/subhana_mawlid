## What is Subḥāna Mawlid?
It is a mawlid compilation that is widely recited amongst the Tamil Muslims to glorify Allah and send salutations and praise upon our Noble Prophet ﷺ. It is commonly recited in the birth month of the Prophet ﷺ, Rabiul Awwal.

## Why am I doing this?
The Subḥāna Mawlid is part of the spiritual heritage of Tamil Muslims and has been recited in Tamil mosques in countries like India, Sri Lanka and Singapore. But it is getting rare to see the youth attending such gatherings. The only translations available seem to be in Tamil but the 5/6 mawlid compilation books found in Singapore Tamil mosques do not have any translation; most people reciting the mawlid are therefore unable to understand its meanings. It is saddening to see that we are slowly losing this treasure and some might not even be aware of it. I would therefore like to contribute towards continuing and propagating this tradition amongst local Tamil Muslim youth. By having English translations alongside the original Arabic text, I hope that more people can learn to appreciate its significance. In addition to producing a PDF document for those who prefer a print/document style, I believe a website would be convenient for most people, as it allows for easy on-screen toggling of the translation, quick searching and wide accessibility across many devices. The younger generation also prefers accessing web apps on mobile. This project os therefore for the community of our Beloved Messenger ﷺ.

## What am I doing?
The development of this will take place in 2 phases, insha Allah:
1) Translating the baiths (qasidahs)
2) Translating the hikayats (hadith/stories)

For both of these phases, the following need to be done:
1) Use OCR to digitise the Arabic text from book
2) Add tashkeel
3) Translate to English (translate from Tamil to English and check against Arabic dictionary for accuracy)
4) Create web pages and copy the Arabic and English texts into text files

The current priority is to finish phase 1 first. It might take about 0.5 ~ 1 year. When the whole project is completed, I aim to approach the local Tamil mosques and request them to use this document and app during their mawlid gatherings.

## How can you help?
I need help with translation because I do not know Arabic. You can proofread the Arabic texts and translations and/or contribute translations; please view the Word doc on a computer. If you are a web dev, I want to listen to your feedback and even accept pull requests if you want to work on this with me. You can message me on Telegram/Instagram/Twitter <a href="https://t.me/anas_z15">@anas_z15</a> first to share your ideas or ask any queries you may have.

## Am I benefitting from this?
This project is open source and will stay that way. I will not profit from this endeavour in any way and I want to ensure this project's sustainability with low, or better still, zero cost solutions. I therefore do not need sponsorships/donations at the moment.
