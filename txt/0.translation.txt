There has come to you a messenger from among yourselves, concerned over your suffering, anxious over you. Towards the believers, he is compassionate and merciful. If they turn away, say, “God is enough for me; there is no god except He; in Him I have put my trust; He is the Lord of the Sublime Throne.” Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but (he is) the Messenger of Allah, and the Seal of the Prophets: and Allah has full knowledge of all things. Verily Allah and His angels send blessings on the Prophet: O you who believe! Send your blessings on him, and salute him with all respect. In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Indeed, We have given you, [O Muhammad], a clear conquest. That Allah may forgive for you what preceded of your sin and what will follow and complete His favour upon you and guide you to a straight path. And [that] Allah may aid you with a mighty victory.
